                    <div class="og_4">
                        <p>The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Ōtsutsuki, the elder son <br>of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. Through Indra, the Uchiha inherited <br>Hagoromo's "eyes", granting them powerful spiritual energy <br>and chakra. As part of the so-called "Curse of Hatred" first <br>displayed by Indra, Uchiha are subject to powerful emotions: <br>these emotions typically start as love for a friend or family <br>member that then become overpowering hatred when the <br>object of their love is lost. This loss, whether actually <br>experienced or merely threatened, awakens an Uchiha's <br>Sharingan. It is due to the Sharingan that the Uchiha have <br>received much of their fame and notoriety.
                            The Uchiha have <br>been fighting the Senju clan for centuries, a rivalry that traces <br>back to the days of Indra and his younger brother, Asura. <br>When the Sage of Six Paths was dying, he selected Asura as <br>his successor, believing Asura's desire for peace through love was better than Indra's peace through power. Indra, driven by his Curse of Hatred, fought Asura to claim what he believed was his birthright. The Uchiha and Senju, descendants of Indra and Asura respectively, continued their battle through the centuries, though none still remembered this reason for their conflict

                        <p>In the decades following the massacre, the Police Force would <br>be placed under the authority of the Fūma Clan, themselves <br>distant relatives of the Uchiha. Only three Uchiha survived <br>their clan's downfall: Itachi, by publicly acting as a criminal by <br>joining The Akatsuki, continued serving Konoha for the rest of 
                            <br>his life until finally dying while fighting Sasuke, Sasuke, by <br>seeking power (at Itachi’s insistence) at any cost so that he <br>could someday kill Itachi, a pursuit that drove him to eventually <br>defect from Konoha and become an international criminal, and <br>Tobi, whose real name was Obito Uchiha, who kept to the 
                            <br>shadows for many years following his apparent death during <br>the Third Shinobi World War, only taking public actions after <br>Itachi's death so that he can gain Sasuke's assistance during <br>the Fourth Shinobi World War. From learning from Obito about <br>what Konoha forced Itachi to do, Sasuke initially decides to destroy Konoha to take revenge. When he's able to talk with a reincarnated Itachi, however, he changes his mind, as Konoha's destruction would make all that Itachi sacrificed meaningless.

                        <p>The Uchiha clan are most feared for their dōjutsu kekkei <br>genkai, the Sharingan. They can use their Sharingan to see <br>chakra, cast various genjutsu, and, most infamously, copy <br>opponents' jutsu. The Sharingan is such a versatile ability that <br>many ninja consider it wiser to flee than to face an Uchiha in <br>one-on-one combat. The Sharingan can be evolved into 
                            <br>Mangekyō Sharingan by experiencing the loss of a loved one, <br>granting the wielder usage of a new, more powerful jutsu in <br>both of their eyes. Overuse of the Mangekyō Sharingan <br>eventually robs the user of their sight, something that can only <br>be restored by receiving another's eyes, preferably a sibling's, to <br>create an "eternal" Mangekyō Sharingan. The Mangekyō <br>
                            Sharingan's mechanics were long poorly misunderstood by the <br>Uchiha, causing many to personally kill their loved ones to gain <br>power. Tobirama Senju has also noted that the Sharingan can feed off an Uchiha’s strong emotions to further increase their power, usually from hate. This was often shown with Sasuke Uchiha, as whenever he used his Sharingan in moments of intense hatred, others would remark how his chakra would grow stronger, darker, and even more sinister as a result of that hatred.
